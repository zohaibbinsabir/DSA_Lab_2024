Question:
Describe the process of code compilation and execution in python. How the byte code will be generated? 
How the process is different from C#. Write in your own words. 

Ans:
The difference is as follows
Python:
	In python, our human code is first converted into a bytecode and it is stored in .pyc extension in a folder.
	if a user run a program again and again without change the interpreter will run the same .pyc file.
	python is an interpreter language. there is no creation of .exe or .dll file at the end. so no standalone file for this.

C#:
	C-Sharp on the other hand, will be converted to intermediate language and then we need .NET to run our compiled code.
	it creates a standalone .exe or .dll file.
	it is an Compiler language
